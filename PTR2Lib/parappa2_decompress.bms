# if this script gives you issues, replace the third line with these following two lines:
#
# set UNCOMPSIZE ? ?
# clog "originalfolder.dat" 0 SIZE UNCOMPSIZE
#
# QuickBMS will ask you to set UNCOMPSIZE upon running those two lines. 
# Set it to the uncompressed size (in bytes) of the folder you're trying to decompress.
# I highly suggest adding some padding to the bytesize.
